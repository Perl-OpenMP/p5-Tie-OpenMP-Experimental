Tie::OpenMP::Experimental

The goal of this repository and name space is to do some
language exploration on the best way to marry C<Tie::>'d
things and underlying C<Inline::C> functions that have been
threaded using OpenMP.

Most ideas and attempts will not be what we want, but if
we keep at this long enough to develop some intuition about
what would work; then some viable options will be found.

Challenges Check List

Attempts at Scalar interfaces:

  Title:
    OpenMP::Experimental::Scalar::ArrayReduceSum
  Implementation:
    ./lib/Tie/OpenMP/Experimental/Scalar/ArrayReduceSum.pm
  Driver:
    ./examples/tie-sum.pl
  Status/Comment:
    Probably not what we want because it presents a very specific
    operation to be done over an array as a fetch of a scalar. This
    means, for one thing, that this approach requires a different
    scalar value for each kind of operation one wishes to perform
    over the underlying array of numbers.
